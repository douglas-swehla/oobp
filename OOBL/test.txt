quit 
This is the second test. 
This is the second line of the second test. It is really long, longer than the 80-character width of the command prompt window. In fact, it's a whole paragraph - how about that! The main thing to note is that the final line shouldn't contain the word "quit", since that is treated as a command by the script.
